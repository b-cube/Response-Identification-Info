    "TF-IDF is commonly used for determining duplicate content on websites. It has been presented as the solution for determining duplicate metadata content. However, work demonstrating its utility in these kinds of tasks are generally limited to a single metadata specification and/or metadata generated from a single system. This is not a realistic approach as we deal with metadata across different kinds of federated platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this demonstration, we have three sets of metadata - from three data portals, we've collected multiple representations of the same dataset. So for one dataset, for example, we have a DIF record, an FGDC record and an ISO record. We are assuming that much of the text within those documents is the same and that the majority of the difference is related to the differences between the standards.\n",
    "\n",
    "So these are sets of metadata we know describe one dataset (each set). Using common tools, can we identify those automatically?\n"
