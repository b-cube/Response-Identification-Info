Hydrographic survey data primarily consist water depths, but also include features (e.g. rocks, wrecks), navigation aids, shoreline identification, bottom type information. NOAA is responsible for archiving distributing the source data as described in this metadata record. These hydrographic data are made available to the public for a wide variety uses, such as sea-bottom characterization, habitat classification, coastal studies, boundary issues, tsunami forecasting. These data are not intended to be used for navigation. Nautical charts produced certified by NOAA should be used for navigation purposes.

The three primary sources survey data are NOAA survey ships, national response teams, contract vessels. The ships collect data, conduct basic board data processing then send these data to NGDC for archival \"RAW\" data. After archiving the RAW data NGDC sends the data to the processing branches (Atlantic or Pacific) for further processing. The processing branches complete processing these data generate products. The processed survey data is sent to NGDC for archival the products are sent to the Hydrographic Surveys Division (HSD) for approval. Once products are approved by HSD, these survey products are sent to NGDC for archival posting on-line.
